# Manage Customers
Customers are a way to differentiate your various implementations of xConnect gateways in a meaningful way. The platform supports a Managed Service Provider (MSP) model, which means that a single xConnect instance can have one or more customers that are being maintained. 

Any customers added will appear in the left-side menu:
