# Manage Customers
Customers are a way to differentiate your various implementations of xConnect gateways in a meaningful way. The platform supports a Managed Service Provider (MSP) model, which means that a single xConnect instance can have one or more customers that are being maintained. 

Any customers added will appear in the left-side menu:

## Disabling and Reactivating a Customer
Disabling a customer will remove them from appearing in the side menu, and will remove the associated gateways from the monitoring dashboards.
Prior to disabling a customer, you **must** disable any associated gateways. Failure to do so will produce an error message indicating that you cannot disable the customer(s) with the associated gateways. 
You can disable a customer by performing the following steps:

1\. Log in as a power user

2\. Click on the settings icon on the header menu

3\. Once on the Manage Customers page, you can select one or more customers via the checkbox on the left. 
When 1 or more customers are checked, you can click either the "Activate" or "Disable" button.
