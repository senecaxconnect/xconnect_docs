# Side Navigation
The primary navigation for xConnect can be found on the header of the portal. Navigating your devices can be done using the left-side navigation on the dashboards. 
The header navigation can be used to access the settings and bookmarks menus.

## 1) Resources List / Left-side Menu
The resources list ![Side Navigation](images/menu_hometab.png "") is the left-side navigation that allows you to view all of your customers, gateways, servers and devices. 
This is used to access the various dashboards featured in the portal.
You can also modify the location, and names of your resources via the edit mode. 

### Editing a resource
 In order to activate the edit view on the side menu, click the icon in the lower-right corner of the menu:

![Side Navigation](images/bookmark_icon.png "") Allows you to mark a resource for bookmark - the resource will be listed on the bookmarks tab. 
 
![Side Navigation](images/menu_location_pin.png "") Allows you to define a location for the resource, which will add a pin on the dashboard's Geo-View panel.

#### Specifying a location
In edit mode, click the location icon ![Side Navigation](images/menu_location_pin.png ""), which will open the location modal.
