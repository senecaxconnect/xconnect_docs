# Agent Installation
If you purchased an appliance from Seneca, it may already contain the xConnect Server Agent.

However, it is highly recommended to always download and install the latest version available at time of setup.

## Installation
1. Download the latest xConnect Agent, found at www.senecaxconnect.com (Click the Download Agent link)
2. Proceed with installation (Run as Administrator), completing all prompts.

    !!! note
        Make sure to run as Administrator! (Right-click the installation file and click Run As Administrator)
 



## Configuration (Cloud-Enablement)
1. Access the Agent Configuration Portal by going to
http://localhost:8885/ (Also available by double clicking the xConnect icon in the system tray)
2. Click on the “Settings” navigation item at the top of the
page. 
3. In the “Gateway Address:” field, enter
the IP address of your gateway.
4. (Skip this step if using a Virtual gateway) In the “Gateway Hostname:” field, enter the hostname of
the gateway device. This will look like XCGW-xxxxxx which is
identified with a label your purchased Gateway device. 
5. Once the IP address and the hostname of the gateway
has been entered, check the “Enable Cloud” checkbox
and click the Save Changes button
