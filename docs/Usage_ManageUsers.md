# Manage Users
Power users have the ability to add, remove or modify existing users on their xConnect instance. 
Limited power users have similar rights to power user, but cannot execute batch commands.
End users can be associated with a specific customer which will show that customer's dashboard to the end user upon login.


1\. Log in as a power user

2\. Click on the settings gear on the header menu
