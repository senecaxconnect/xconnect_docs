# Gateway

This is a required component of the xConnect Remote Management Platform. This physical or
virtual gateway is responsible for being the encrypted tunnel between the Server Agents and the
Web Client Dashboard hosted in our cloud.

There are three installation options for this Secure Gateway:

- Physical (Turnkey)
- Virtual Machine
- Docker Container

## Physical (Turnkey) Gateway 
The physical gateway option greatly reduces setup time. This is a physical hardware device
provided by Arrow that has our hardened system image and most configuration details already
pre-configured from our factory.

The physical gateway highlighted in this guide is an ultra-small form factor embedded PC
provided by Arrow. The specifications of this physical gateway are:

Onboarding/Installation instructions are available in the [Getting Started](/xconnect_docs/Getting_Started) chapter. 

## Virtual Machine Gateway Option
The virtual gateway option is available when using existing infrastructure to host the Secure
Gateway is desired.

A Hyper-V Virtual Disk or VMWare OVA can be provided upon request and needs to be imported into the
 appropriate hypervisor. 
 
!!! note
    It is recommended to have 2 virtual switches attached to the VM. 1 Virtual Switch with connectivity
    to your internal LAN assets, and 1 Virtual Switch with Internet connectivity.

Professional Services are available to assist in importing and configuration of the virtual Secure
Gateway.

Onboarding/Installation instructions are available in the "Getting Started" chapter. 

## Docker Container

We now support deploying a "bare minimum" Gateway image via Docker. This option allows you to have 
an xConnect Secure Gateway deployed in minutes, granted you can supply a machine that Docker can be installed on.

As of this writing, you can use any Linux OS of your choosing to deploy the xConnect Gateway software with Docker.

Container installation instruction files are available on our github page:
<https://github.com/senecaxconnect/xconnect_gateway_docker>

!!! note
    Docker for Windows will not be officially supported until WSL2 is publicly available. However,
    you could install a Linux OS within a Hyper-V VM on Windows and it would be fully supported.

!!! note
    Certain features (Remote Desktop Pass-through and Seneca Remote Support Services) will **NOT** be available 
    (without Seneca consultation) when using the Docker gateway:

Installation instructions are also available in the "Getting Started" chapter. 

## Secure Gateway Services
The xConnect Secure Gateway is a device, or virtual machine, that runs a customized and
hardened Ubuntu Server system image. Within this image are several key services:

#### Arrow Connect Gateway Engine
This service is the main data consumption and transmission engine responsible for
ingesting telemetry from all Server Agents and transmitting telemetry to Arrow Connect
IoT. Arrow Connect IoT provides telemetry to the Web Client Dashboard through secure
APIs.

#### Gateway Configuration Manager
This is a built-in local (or LAN accessible) web interface for configuration all relevant
features to the xConnect Remote Management Platform.

!!! note
    Not available with Docker container

#### Remote Desktop Gateway
This is a service that provides client-less remote desktop connections from the Web
Client Dashboard through to the Server Agent system. At time of this publication, RDP is
the only protocol supported.

!!! note
    Not available with Docker container

#### Secure Tunnel Service
This service provides secure HTTP and TCP tunnels to and from the Web Client
Dashboard and the private network being managed. All connections are encrypted web
sockets through port 443 (HTTPS).

!!! note
    Not available with Docker container

## Network Requirements
The xConnect Secure Gateway requires very minimal network configuration or firewall rules to
be fully functional. Some common industry standard ports that are required to be open are:

### Agent --> Gateway Access Requirement
This is typically on your LAN so access rules are rarely required unless running on a hardened network.

In the case of internal LAN traffic being managed, verify the following access is granted between 
the hosts (Agents) and the Gateway asset
- Port 8080 (TCP/HTTP)
- Port 1883 (TCP/MQTT)

### Gateway --> Cloud Access Requirement

Microsoft Azure access is bare minimum required:
- Destination IPs will vary based on region and load-balancing so a hostname based rule is preferred.
- A wildcard access rule for outbound traffic to *.senecaxconnect.com is the safest bet to future proof your firewall rules.
- Outbound TCP traffic via **Port 443** to *.senecaxconnect.com
- Outbound TCP traffic via **Port 8883** to *.senecaxconnect.com
- **No inbound rules required** 
                                                                            
Amazon EC2 access is optional but is highly recommend and required for the following features to function:
- Seneca’s administrative interface to connect to your gateway to push updates
- Server Agent OTA updates
- General support/troubleshooting of your gateway
- Secure Remote Desktop Passthrough
- If you wish to opt-in to these features and enable our team to continually support your platform, 
please whitelist **Outbound TCP 443** to ***.ngrok.io** and ***.ngrok.com**. 
We cannot provide a reliable IP address list due to auto load balancing on the cluster, 
they’re a moving target.
