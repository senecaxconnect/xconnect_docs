### Removing, Enabling or Disabling Devices
You can remove, disable or re-enable a disabled device by using the checkboxes on the left side of the grid and the action buttons on the table header. 

**Removing** a device will cause the device and associated telemetry to be removed from the system. 

**Disabling** a device will remove the device from the left-side menu and you will no longer receive alerts for that device.

**Enabling** a device will make it appear on the side menu again. NOTE: You will have to set up any custom events/alerts again if this was disabled prior.
